# Patient-Outcome-Prediction
Analysed patient data to predict outcomes and identify key recovery factors, contributing to better healthcare strategies.

Skills: Python, R, SQL, Hadoop

Tools and Frameworks:
Programming Languages: Python, R
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
Machine Learning Frameworks: Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
Big Data Technologies: Hadoop, Spark
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Deployment: Flask, FastAPI, Docker

Plan:
1. Define the prediction objectives and target outcomes.
Collect patient data, including medical history, treatment plans, and outcomes.

2. Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess data using Pandas (handle missing values, normalization, feature selection).
Use Spark for processing large datasets.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize data using Seaborn and Matplotlib to understand trends and distributions.
Perform correlation analysis to identify key factors affecting outcomes.

4. Model Development:
Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
Training and Validation: Split data into training and validation sets. Train models using Scikit-Learn or TensorFlow.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model performance using Grid Search or Random Search.

5. Model Evaluation:
Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Select the best-performing model based on evaluation results.

6. Deployment:
Develop a web service using Flask or FastAPI to deploy the prediction model.
Containerize the application using Docker for easy deployment.

7. Monitoring and Maintenance:
Set up monitoring for model performance and retrain the model periodically with new data.
Update the model as needed based on feedback and new data.

8. Documentation and Communication:
Document the model development process, code, and deployment steps.
Communicate results and usage instructions to stakeholders.
